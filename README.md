# Google_Capstone_Project
This Capstone Project is a part of Coursera Google Analytics Course
## Overview
This Capstone project was the final project in Coursera's Google Analytics course. In this project, I analysed the bank marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* The data (bank-additional-full.csv) was related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese bank. The data consisted of 41188 rows and 21 columns.

* The end goal of this campaign is to find out whether the campaign was successful to motivate customers to subscribe to a bank term deposit.

* Randomly targeting every customer leads to wastage of time and resources. The analysis would also help us identify the right demographic to target for bank marketing campaign in future and return a better return on investment (ROI).

The insights and analysis can be found [here](
